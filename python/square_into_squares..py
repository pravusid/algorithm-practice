# Task
# Given a positive integral number n, return a strictly increasing sequence (list/array/string depending on the language) of numbers, so that the sum of the squares is equal to n².

# If there are multiple solutions (and there will be), return the result with the largest possible values:

# Examples
# decompose(11) must return [1,2,4,10]. Note that there are actually two ways to decompose 11², 11² = 121 = 1 + 4 + 16 + 100 = 1² + 2² + 4² + 10² but don't return [2,6,9], since 9 is smaller than 10.

# For decompose(50) don't return [1, 1, 4, 9, 49] but [1, 3, 5, 8, 49] since [1, 1, 4, 9, 49] doesn't form a strictly increasing sequence.
